RxRiddles
=========

This repository contains some riddles for RxJava to help you learn and master RxJava. There is an [accompanying medium article](https://medium.com/@vanniktech/riddling-your-way-to-master-rxjava-145d5de99b55) that gives some more information.

Each riddle is in a single file with an accompanying unit test that will check your implementation. Next to the unit test, I have also put up my solution. Note that there are multiple ways to achieve and solve the riddles but usually there's a dedicated operator or function that I want to show you.

The riddles are not sorted in any real preference and I plan to keep it that way. Just start with whichever one you prefer. Riddles with numbers lower than 100 can be solved with a single operator while every other riddle requires multiple operators.

### Contributing

I'm very open to having some more riddles. Especially some complex common use cases. In case you want to contribute create an issue and let's talk.

I want every riddle to be unique and have as little duplication as possible while also having some actual real-world use case for each riddle in mind. Something you can relate to and hopefully use in your everyday life.

### RxJS

There is an initiative in [RxRiddles-TypeScript](https://github.com/jakovljevic-mladen/RxRiddles-TypeScript) project to re-write riddles from this project to RxJS and TypeScript. Take a look if you're interested.
